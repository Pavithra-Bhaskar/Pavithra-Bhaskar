# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pavithra Bhaskar

Iâ€™m into data â€” exploring it, cleaning it, and building useful dashboards with it

Currently working on:
- Cleaning real-world datasets using Python (pandas)
- Building interactive dashboards with Power BI
- Learning more about SQL and data analysis
- Working on data science projects involving machine learning & real-world insights

I enjoy solving problems with data and turning it into something clear and actionable.
