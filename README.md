# 👋 Hi, I'm Pavithra Bhaskar

I'm interested in working with data- cleaning it, analyzing it, and turning it into something useful and clear.

### 📌 What I'm Doing Now
- Cleaning real-world datasets using **Python (pandas)**
- Building interactive dashboards with **Power BI**
- Practicing SQL for querying and data exploration

### 🚧 What's Next
- Building small **machine learning projects** using scikit-learn
- Creating **interactive data apps with Streamlit**
- Exploring end-to-end workflows: from raw data → analysis → app/dashboard

I like keeping things practical, clean, and focused on solving real problems.
